**Vibe Machine** is a browser-based instrument for creating deep, immersive audio visualizations. It combines high-performance Web Audio API physics with a "Cinematic Ether" aesthetic designed to turn your music library into a visual experience.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **High-Energy Physics**: Custom-tuned `Attack/Decay` envelopes for visuals that snap to the beat and breathe with the bass.
*   **Cinematic Ether Design**: A "Dark Mode First" UI built on glassmorphism, deep obsidian backgrounds, and electric amber accents.
*   **Immersion Mode**: One-click "Cinema Mode" dissolves the UI entirely, leaving only the music and the art.
*   **Smart Typography**: Dynamic font rendering on the HTML5 Canvas, supporting modern, elegant, and technical typefaces.
*   **Analog Texture**: Subtle film grain and noise overlays for a tactile, non-digital feel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Core**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Custom "Cinema Scope" configuration)
*   **Audio**: Native Web Audio API (`AnalyserNode`, `GainNode`)
*   **Visuals**: HTML5 Canvas 2D Context (Procedural animation)
*   **Icons**: Lucide React

## 🎨 Aesthetic Philosophy

**"Emptiness is not nothing—it is potential."** — Kenya Hara

Vibe Machine rejects the "dashboard" template. It is designed as a HUD (Heads-Up Display) that floats over your content.
*   **Dissolve the Container**: No opaque backgrounds. Everything is glass.
*   **Electric Amber**: A single, confident accent color (`#f59e0b`) replaces generic blue/indigo.
*   **Deep Obsidian**: Backgrounds are `#050505`, not gray.

## ⌨️ Controls

*   **Space**: Play / Pause
*   **CMD+K**: Toggle Command Center (Future) / Quick Actions
*   **ESC**: Exit Cinema Mode
